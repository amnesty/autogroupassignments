  <description>
    Auto Group Assignments allows you to specify a default group for each contact created
    (by members of another specified group).
    
    Lets say that you have, for instance, three groups in CiviCRM: administrators,
    teachers and students. The administrators, normally, use CiviCRM to create teacher
    records. The teachers use to create student records.
    
    With this extension, you'll be able to assign the "Default Group for New Contacts"
    when you create, or modify a group. So, for Administrators, you'll choose Teachers
    and for Teachers you'll choose Students.
    
    From this time on, when a administrator creates a contact, by default, it will be
    assigned, by default, to he teachers group.
